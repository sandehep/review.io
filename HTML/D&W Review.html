	<h1 style="color:brown">DEADPOOL & WOLVERIN Review:</h1>
<p style="color:red">
    This film is an ammazing film after a long gap or break marvel returns with an banger Huge Jackmans perfomence as wolverin and seeing him in the big screen was just awesome and the opening title card sequence still running in my mind. Past few years marvel was in it's low point and then Deadpool the marvel jesus came to save marvel. But their are some negative in this movie timeline confusion is a big plothole in this movie this movie has a big timeline confusion but it's has noting to do with the films success. About the timeline we disscus it later.
